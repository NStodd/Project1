###### Description
_Do you remember Successories? Those old school motivational posters from the 90s?_

This project is intended to let you make your own!

It uses an image api ([Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)) and a quote api ([themotivate365](https://api.themotivate365.com/stoic-quote)). And puts them together in a nice, screenshottable, format.

If you see a quote that you aren't crazy about, just hit the 'New Quote' button to get a new one!
If you don't like the photo, do the same thing with the 'New Image' button!
Or you can change both with 'New Combo'!

##### Stretch Goals
- Allow the user to pick between different types of quotes (motivational, zen, stoic, etc...).
- Allow the user to set an interval of time by which the site will give them a new one automatically.
- Allow the user to choose a word or phrase to influence the scene.
- Allow the user to save or 'favorite' a quote/image combination.
- Track what quotes/images are seen/favorited more frequently.
- Add a keyword/title to resemble the old posters.

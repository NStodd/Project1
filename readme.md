###### Description
My project will help users in their coding and work life by giving them a motivational quote with a nice background image.
The user will be able to cycle the quote, the image or both.
The site will display on both desktop and mobile, adjusting to either one.

##### Stretch Goals
- Allow the user to pick between motivational, zen or stoic quotes.
- Allow the user to set an interval by which the site will give them a new one automatically.
- Allow the user to select an input that the quote and/or image will take into account when creating their motivational scene.
- Allow the user to save or 'favorite' a quote/image combination.

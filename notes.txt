OOOOOOOOOOK.

Where I'm At:
- set up the initial pages -
- set up version control in git hub w/ a repo -
- set up an outward-facing page in vercel - 
- got api calls and displayed the objects -


Where I need to go next:
- dig into the two api objects
- get an image from pixabay to display (just in a normal image block).
- get the quote from inspiration api to display in its own block.
- hook up a listener to retrieve a random new image & refresh
- hook up a listener to retrieve a random new quote & refresh
- hook up a button to do both
- credit pixabay somewhere
- make it look nice on both desktop and mobile
- refine the image search to make sure that it finds varied and good images
-         use the other search criteria from pixabay: 



Where to go from there:
- format the page.
     - option 1: make it look like one of those office motivation posters
     - option 2: make the text appear over the image in some nice way
     - option 3: like option 1 but with a title word.
- show/hide the buttons to get new quotes
- pull quotes from another api and let the user pick which type of quote they want
- set an automatic refresh on either or both api element being displayed.

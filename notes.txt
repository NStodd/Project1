OOOOOOOOOOK.

Where I'm At:
- set up the initial pages -
- set up version control in git hub w/ a repo -
- set up an outward-facing page in vercel - 
- got api calls and displayed the objects -
- dig into the two api objects -
- get an image from pixabay to display (just in a normal image block). -
- hook up a listener to retrieve a random new image & refresh -
- get the quote from inspiration api -
- display the quote -
- hook up a listener to retrieve a random new quote & refresh -
- hook up a button to do both -
- make sure I'm getting quote api data correctly-
- formatting the height/width -
- making responsive for mobile -
- formatting buttons -

Where I need to go next:
- credit pixabay somewhere
- google font and font color
- refine the image search 



Where to go from there:
- format the page.
     - option 1: make it look like one of those office motivation posters
     - option 2: make the text appear over the image in some nice way
     - option 3: like option 1 but with a title word.
- show/hide the buttons to get new quotes
- pull quotes from another api and let the user pick which type of quote they want
- set an automatic refresh on either or both api element being displayed.
- create a motivation_object Object.
- change fonts for the quote
